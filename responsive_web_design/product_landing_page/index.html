                    <h3 class="info-head">EVA</h3>
                    <p class="info-dump">I recommend EVA as the closed cell foam in front of the core in this design. The open cell tip does enough of the absorbing of energy that closed cell polyolefin/polyethylene (camp pad) is not required. I opted for the more durable and shock absorbent (poly) ethylene-vinyl acetate, EVA or PEVA. EVA is considered a rubber foam and is used in products like sport shoes as a shock absorber. It normally comes in two densities, 2lbs and 4lbs. 2lbs can be found as craft foam in thin sheets. The 4lbs can be found as cosplayer foam. I recommend the 4lbs as it is more durable than the 2lbs. Belegarth recommends 4lbs to build up cores and 2lbs for striking surfaces. The 6mm of 4lbs is very comparable to 6mm of rubber or horse mat.</p>
                    <h3 class="info-head">Pool Noodle</h3>
                    <p class="info-dump">I will admit that this was an odd choice. Nearly all pool noodles are made from closed cell polyethylene (there might be a theme here). They also have the reputation of being the worst kind of closed cell polyethylene. This is not always true. Inspecting the noodle before you buy is a very good idea. I attempted to find the densest noodle I could. Oodles of Noodles is a manufacturer which would provide data, except they do not ship to my location. If it is available, I would recommend researching them.</p>
                    <p class="info-dump">The reason I went with a noodle at all is because it is used in the least significant way on the arrow, along with being convenient. It is only used to make a cosmetic cone shape and provides surface area to secure the core. This part does not take much of the force of the arrow. 3D printed arrowhead bases are now a thing. They remove this area of foam all together. The convenience is that the hole in the noodle is about the same as the penny, which is about the same as the core. This means no drilling required.</p>
                    <h3 class="info-head">Open cell</h3>
                    <p class="info-dump">The open cell foam must be sufficiently firm. The anecdotal advice is a bit harder than couch cushions. Belegarth recommends finding grey computer foam. Some people may recommend finding densities, but the density does not define the properties of the foam. The density is still useful when comparing very similar foams, mostly for weight. The important number to understand is <a class="text-link" href="https://www.pfa.org/foam-performance/" target="_blank">IDF</a>. There are other important metrics, see linked. For instance, the resilience percent is the amount of return bounce after dropping a steel ball into it. This can correlate to how much your arrows bounce back off people. Bounce back is normally frowned upon as the nock is arguably the most dangerous part of LARP arrows. Ask foam manufactures for the datasheets on their foam. Most business provide this information as tested by the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standard.</p>
