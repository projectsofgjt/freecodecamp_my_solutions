                <p>This is a guide to archery from my perspective. I believe that everyone can become a proficient, self-taught archer if they put in the effort. My knowledge comes from free online sources. In each section I will have a description, then link to multiple videos on that subject. The links will be in order of relevance. There are many other ways to learn, for example I have also used archery forums and blogs, free pdf books, and the like. I should also mention I am not formally trained in Olympic style or compound hunting but will still mention them.</p>

                <p>Bows are weapons not toys. For nearly any draw weight, even those under 10lbs, they can still be considered lethal weapons under law. Even the kid’s suction cup arrow bows can be dangerous. Just by shooting a normal arrow, they can do serious harm.</p>
                <p>Never point your bow at other people, and at ranges keep it pointed down range. If you are making your own range at home pay attention to what is behind your range as well as in it.</p>
                <p>Never dry fire a bow. A dry fire is when you fire the bow without an arrow. This is dangerous and can cause your bow to break. A string breaking can take out an eye, and a bow breaking can cause many different types of injuries.</p>

                <p>There are multiple things that are required to start archery. The first is a bow. Then you need the safety gear. Next you need arrows. Finally, you need somewhere to shoot.</p>
                <p>To start out in archery it is an investment of about $300 for the basic, but still quality, equipment. The bow will cost around $200, arrows will be about $50, and then $50 for safety gear and maintenance equipment like string wax. If you want to spend less than that, then I suggest making your own bow if you have wood working skills or make a PVC bow. Please see the making a bow section.</p>
                <h1>Finding a Bow</h1>
                <p>Before you buy a bow, you should know what you want to do with it. If you want to hunt, then check local rules about poundage in hunting. If you want to compete then you need a bow that meets the Olympic style rules. If you want to do traditional archery, then there are many types of historical bows. If you want to do backyard archery, then you can really have any kind of bow.</p>
                <p>Most hunters prefer to use compound bows. I have very little experience with compounds. Hunters also use a trigger release most of the time. A trigger release grabs the string instead of your fingers. Some hunters do prefer to use a recurve or traditional bow.</p>
                <p>Olympic style shooters either use an Olympic recurve or takedown recurve. Takedown recurves are significantly cheaper and are the most common for new archers.</p>
                <p>Backyard archers take a more casual approach to archery. Any type of bow is acceptable, the most common starter bow is still a takedown recurve.</p>
                <p>If you want to do traditional archery you either must make your own bow or order a specialty bow from somewhere online. Quick note here, horse bows popularity has massively grown in recent years and are readily available. The thing is almost none of them are historically accurate.</p>

                <p>Making a bow can be a fun and enjoyable hobby. There are a few ways to make bows. The first is PVC bows. These are super easy, but still have a great variety. The other is to build traditional, or even untraditional bows. These are normally made from wood and require normal woodworking tools. The thing to be aware of is the bow makers axiom “If you are not breaking bows, then you are not making bows.” Most people do not make a successful bow on their first try. I have broken many bows and have only had one last the endurance test that is letting my friends use them. Even the best bow makers break a bow every now and then.</p>
                <h1>My Goal</h1>
                <p>I want to expose you to the idea of bow making. I am far from qualified to write a comprehensive instructional guide on bow making. I just want to give an overview of the process and explain terminology so you can research the topic. I have linked to YouTube channels that I have watched and learned from. I like some of them more than others. It is just a starting place. Explore their channels and learn about the specific types of bows that interest you.</p>
                <p>I have spent most of my time researching historical bow technologies instead of making bows. To be exact I have written multiple 5-10-page papers on bow technology in relation to Alaskan Natives, evidence for ancient people migrating across Beringia, and why hide glue wasn’t used by Arctic groups. My thing with bow making is it is more about the research and less about the making or using. A lot of modern bowyers have a more casual view towards archery.</p>
